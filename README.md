In this project, I have used a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology , cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. 

I have used following algorithms to build this model:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
